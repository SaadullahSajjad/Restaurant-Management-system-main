Open VS code: 
Navigate to the project directory: Change into the project directory using the following command:

cd my-react-app
replace "my-react-app" with the actual name of your project.

Install dependencies: Run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

npm install
This will read the package.json file and download all the required packages specified in it.

Start the development server: To run your React project locally, use the following command:

npm start
This command will start the development server, and your React application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Now you can start developing your React project, and any changes you make to the code will automatically be reflected in the browser, thanks to the hot-reloading feature of Create React App. Happy coding! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
